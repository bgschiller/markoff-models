## Markoff Models

In the spirit of the [STUPID SHIT NO ONE NEEDS & TERRIBLE IDEAS HACKATHON](http://www.stupidhackathon.com/) and Develop Denver's Ballmer Peak hackathon, I present: Markoff Models.

They're Markov Models, but sometimes (20% of the time) they throw in a word without regard for the weights.
