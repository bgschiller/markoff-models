## Markoff Models

In the spirit of the [STUPID SHIT NO ONE NEEDS & TERRIBLE IDEAS HACKATHON](http://www.stupidhackathon.com/) and Develop Denver's Ballmer Peak hackathon, I present: Markoff Models.

They're Markov Models, but sometimes (20% of the time) they throw in a word without regard for the weights.

### Mean Girls

> They were real that day I wore a vest. - Because if you saw a nipple. - That's really interesting. - Thanks.

> Ex-boyfriends are just her little workers.

> All I had a girl on the side to pay for her pathetic divorce.

> I'd never seen anybody so glamorous. - So how do you have your first cousins, - then you cross-multiply and get the value of X. Whatever.

### Trump:

> But Jeff Sessions was there right at the top.

> And because they're stupid.<LAUGHTER> D. <TRUMP:> Thank you.

> But he said -- remember he was chief of Naval Personnel Command for the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words from me and you won't be stopped.

> These people are being poisoned.

> Now, if they are -- don't bleach their e-mails or about Benghazi.

### Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy:

> The force-shielded dome had once seen somebody do on television, but it was an inch, there was a profound relief to everyone else out there, the secret is to try and stay in it

> For a few last flashes of flame entered the bowels of the Galaxy

> Zaphod shook his head thoughtfully and gazed bleakly at it, like a man leaning against an unexpectedly open door

> This pimple of the whisky-glass like affair, and it would probably have been in vain
